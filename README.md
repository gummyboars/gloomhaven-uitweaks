# Gloomhaven UI Tweaks
This mod makes a few changes to user interface:
- Adds per-class achievement filter buttons to the trainer window in guildmaster mode
- Splits attack modifier counters into rows of 5 to make them easier to count
- Remembers the selected character when switching between modes (Merchant, Temple, World Map, etc.)
- Shows new notification icon for unclaimed achievements for consistency with the button at the bottom
